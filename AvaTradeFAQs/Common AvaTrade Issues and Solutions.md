# Common AvaTrade Issues and Solutions

Things go wrong sometimes. Here's how to fix the most common AvaTrade problems without waiting for support.

## Login Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid username or password"

**Solutions:**
1. Check caps lock. Passwords are case-sensitive.
2. Use the email you registered with, not your name.
3. Try the "Forgot Password" link to reset.
4. Clear browser cache and cookies.
5. Try a different browser.

Still stuck? Contact support. Your account may be locked after too many failed attempts.

**Problem:** Two-factor authentication not working

**Solutions:**
1. Check your phone's time settings. 2FA codes are time-sensitive.
2. Make sure you're using the correct authenticator app.
3. Try the backup codes provided during setup.
4. Contact support for 2FA reset.

## Deposit Problems

**Problem:** Deposit not showing in account

**Solutions:**
1. Wait. Card deposits are usually instant but can take up to 24 hours.
2. Check your email for confirmation.
3. Verify the funds left your bank/card.
4. Check you deposited to the correct account number.

Bank wires take 1-5 business days. Don't panic before that window passes.

**Problem:** Deposit rejected

**Common causes:**
- Card doesn't allow international transactions. Call your bank.
- Card doesn't allow gambling-category transactions. Some banks block broker deposits.
- Incorrect card details entered. Try again carefully.
- Card expired. Check the date.
- Daily limit exceeded. Try a smaller amount or different card.

## Withdrawal Issues

**Problem:** Withdrawal taking too long

**Normal timeframes:**
- E-wallets: Same day
- Cards: 1-3 business days
- Bank wire: 3-7 business days

If it's been longer:
1. Check your email for requests (additional verification sometimes needed)
2. Verify withdrawal status in your portal
3. Contact your bank—sometimes they hold incoming international transfers

---

**Problem:** Withdrawal rejected

**Common causes:**
- Verification incomplete. Upload missing documents.
- Withdrawal method different from deposit method (AML rules require this match in many cases).
- Bonus conditions not met. Check if you have locked bonus funds.
- Insufficient balance after accounting for open positions.

## Trading Platform Issues

**Problem:** MT4/MT5 won't connect

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection.
2. Verify server address is correct (provided by AvaTrade).
3. Ensure login credentials are for MT4/MT5, not just web portal.
4. Firewall/antivirus may be blocking. Add exception.
5. Try reinstalling the platform.

**Problem:** Trades not executing / "Off quotes" error

**Solutions:**
1. Markets might be closed. Check trading hours.
2. Spread widened due to volatility. Increase slippage tolerance.
3. Requotes during fast markets are normal. Try again.
4. Check if the instrument is tradeable (some have restricted hours).

**Problem:** Charts not loading

**Solutions:**
1. Right-click chart → Refresh
2. Close and reopen the chart
3. Check if market is open
4. Restart platform
5. Clear platform cache (File → Open Data Folder → delete cache files)

## Account Issues

**Problem:** Verification documents rejected

**Common reasons:**
- Image too blurry. Retake with better lighting.
- Document expired. Use current documents.
- Address doesn't match registration. Use matching document.
- Part of document cut off. Include all corners.

**Problem:** Forgot which email I registered with

**Solutions:**
1. Check old emails for AvaTrade communications.
2. Try common email addresses you use.
3. Contact support with your full name and approximate registration date.

**Problem:** Account shows negative balance

**If you have negative balance protection:** This shouldn't happen. Contact support immediately.

**If you're a professional client:** Negative balances can occur. You may owe the broker money. Contact support to discuss resolution.

## Bonus Issues

**Problem:** Bonus didn't appear after deposit

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 24 hours. Bonuses aren't always instant.
2. Verify you entered the partner code during registration.
3. Check minimum deposit requirement ($1,000 for bonus eligibility).
4. Confirm you're in an eligible region.
5. Contact support with deposit confirmation.

**Problem:** Bonus was removed from account

**Possible reasons:**
