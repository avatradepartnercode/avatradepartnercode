# AvaTrade Partner Commissions Explained

If you're considering the AvaTrade partner program, you probably want to know: how much can you actually earn?

## Commission Structures

AvaTrade offers three main commission models:

### 1. CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)

You get a fixed payment when someone you refer makes a qualifying deposit.

**Typical ranges:**
- Tier 1 countries (US, UK, Australia, EU): $400-800 per client
- Tier 2 countries (Asia, Eastern Europe): $200-400 per client
- Tier 3 countries (rest of world): $100-200 per client

Exact rates depend on:
- Your traffic volume
- Client quality history
- Negotiated terms

CPA is predictable. You know what each conversion is worth.

### 2. Revenue Share

You receive an ongoing percentage of the spread from your referred clients' trading activity.

**Typical ranges:** 20-50% of spread

How it plays out:
- Client trades EUR/USD with 1.0 pip spread
- AvaTrade earns ~$10 on that lot
- Your 30% share = $3 per lot

Revenue share compounds. A single active trader can generate hundreds per month indefinitely.

### 3. Lot Rebates (IB Model)

Fixed amount per lot traded by your clients.

**Typical ranges:**
- Forex majors: $2-5 per lot
- Gold/commodities: $3-7 per lot
- Indices: $1-4 per lot

Volume-based and straightforward to calculate.

## What Determines Your Rate?

AvaTrade negotiates individually. Factors that increase your rates:

**Higher volume:** More referrals = more leverage. Top partners get premium terms.

**Quality traffic:** If your clients deposit large amounts and trade actively, you're valuable.

**Geographic focus:** Tier 1 countries pay better. Targeting wealthy markets helps.

**Exclusivity:** Promoting only AvaTrade (not competitors) may unlock better rates.

**Track record:** Proven history with other affiliate programs strengthens your position.

## Real-World Earnings Examples

**Small affiliate (blog, 1,000 visitors/month):**
- 2-3 sign-ups per month
- $400 CPA × 3 = $1,200/month

**Medium affiliate (YouTube channel, 50,000 subscribers):**
- 15-20 sign-ups per month
- $500 CPA × 18 = $9,000/month
- Plus revenue share from active traders

**Large IB (trading educator, 500 active students):**
- 100 lots/day traded by clients
- $3 per lot × 100 × 22 trading days = $6,600/month
- Plus CPA on new students

These are illustrative. Your results depend on your audience, content quality, and conversion optimization.

## Minimum Payouts

AvaTrade typically has:
- $100-300 minimum threshold before payout
- Monthly payment cycles
- Net 30 or Net 60 payment terms

Small amounts accumulate until you hit threshold. No earnings are lost—just delayed.

## Tracking Your Earnings

Partner dashboard shows:
- Clicks on your links
- Registrations attributed to you
- Deposits and trading activity
- Commission earned
- Pending vs. paid amounts

Check it regularly to understand what's working.

## Optimizing Commissions

**Focus on quality over quantity.** One trader who deposits $10,000 and trades actively is worth more than ten who deposit $100 and disappear.

**Educate your audience.** People who understand trading before signing up become better clients. Better clients mean higher lifetime value.

**Choose the right model.** If your audience is likely to trade actively, revenue share or lot rebates outperform CPA. If they're one-time depositors, CPA is safer.

**Negotiate after proving value.** Start with standard terms. Once you've delivered consistent quality referrals, ask for rate improvements.

## Clawbacks and Chargebacks

Be aware:
- If a client deposits, you get CPA
- If that client gets a refund/chargeback, commission may be clawed back
- Fraudulent referrals result in account termination

Don't try to game the system with fake sign-ups. It doesn't work and destroys legitimate earning potential.

## Tax Implications

Partner commissions are taxable income in most jurisdictions. You're responsible for:
- Tracking your earnings
- Reporting to tax authorities
- Paying applicable taxes

Consider consulting an accountant if you're earning significant amounts. Different structures (individual vs. company) have different implications.
