# How to Become an AvaTrade Partner

Want to earn money by referring traders to AvaTrade? Here's how the partner program works.

## What Is the Partner Program?

AvaTrade pays you when people sign up and trade using your referral link or partner code. It's affiliate marketing for forex.

Two main models:
- **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):** One-time payment when someone deposits
- **Revenue Share:** Ongoing percentage of the spread from referred traders

Some partners use one, some use both. Depends on your agreement with AvaTrade.

## Who Can Join?

The program is open to:
- Website owners (finance, trading, investing niches)
- Social media influencers
- Trading educators and course creators
- Finance YouTubers and bloggers
- Email list owners
- Existing traders who want to refer friends

No minimum traffic or follower count to apply. But higher volume partners get better terms.

## How to Apply

1. Go to AvaTrade's website
2. Find "Partners" or "Affiliates" in the footer
3. Fill out the application form
4. Provide details about how you'll promote
5. Wait for approval (usually 1-5 business days)

Once approved, you get:
- Unique tracking links
- Your own partner code
- Access to marketing materials
- Dashboard to track referrals and earnings

## What You Earn

Rates vary based on:
- Your traffic volume
- Geographic location of referrals
- Negotiated terms

Typical ranges:
- **CPA:** $200-800 per qualified deposit
- **Revenue share:** 20-50% of spread

High-volume partners negotiate better rates. If you're sending hundreds of referrals monthly, you have leverage.

## What Counts as a Qualified Referral?

Usually:
- New customer (not existing AvaTrade client)
- Completes registration
- Verifies identity
- Makes minimum deposit (varies by region)
- Sometimes: Trades a minimum volume

Check your specific agreement. "Qualified" means different things in different contracts.

## Tracking and Attribution

AvaTrade tracks referrals through:
- **Unique links:** URLs with your partner ID embedded
- **Partner codes:** Codes entered during registration
- **Cookies:** Browser cookies tracking click-through (typically 30-90 day window)

Make sure you understand the attribution window. If someone clicks your link but registers 45 days later, do you still get credit?

## Getting Paid

Payment methods include:
- Bank wire transfer
- Skrill
- Neteller
- Other e-wallets depending on region

Minimum payout thresholds apply (often $100-300). Monthly payment cycles are standard.

## What Partners Actually Do

Successful AvaTrade partners typically:

**Content creators:** Write reviews, tutorials, comparisons. Embed affiliate links naturally.

**YouTubers:** Create trading education videos. Mention AvaTrade with referral links in description.

**Educators:** Run courses or signals services. Recommend AvaTrade to students.

**Community builders:** Run Discord servers, Telegram groups, forums. Share partner code with members.

**Paid advertisers:** Run Google/Facebook ads to landing pages that promote AvaTrade.

Different approaches suit different skills. No single "right" way to do this.

## Compliance Rules

AvaTrade requires partners to:
- Disclose affiliate relationships
- Not make false claims about earnings or performance
- Not spam or use black-hat tactics
- Follow advertising regulations in their jurisdiction
- Not promise guaranteed returns

Violations can get you banned from the program and clawed-back on earnings.

## Is It Worth It?

Depends on your audience and effort level.

**Good signs:**
- You already have a finance-interested audience
- You can create genuine value (not just spam links)
- You're willing to learn what converts
- You have patience (building referral income takes time)

**Warning signs:**
- You expect instant income
- Your only plan is posting links everywhere
- You don't understand trading enough to speak credibly
- You're in a heavily restricted geography

Partner programs reward people who build trust with their audience. Quick-money seekers usually fail.

## Getting Started

If you want to explore:

1. Apply to the program (costs nothing)
2. Get approved and receive your materials
3. Start with whatever platform you have (even small)
4. Track what works, improve what doesn't
5. Scale what converts

The partner code 128979 comes from this program. It's how the system works.
