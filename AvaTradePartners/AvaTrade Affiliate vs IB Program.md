# AvaTrade Affiliate vs IB Program

AvaTrade has two referral structures: the affiliate program and the Introducing Broker (IB) program. Different models for different types of partners.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Affiliate | Introducing Broker |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Primary model | CPA + rev share | Spread rebates |
| Relationship | Online referrals | Direct client relationships |
| Support responsibility | AvaTrade handles | IB provides first-line |
| Typical partner | Website owner, influencer | Local broker, educator, signals provider |
| Client interaction | Minimal | Ongoing |
| Earnings structure | Per acquisition/trade | Per lot traded |

## The Affiliate Program

Affiliates send traffic to AvaTrade through digital channels. Websites, social media, email lists, YouTube channels.

**How it works:**
1. You promote AvaTrade with your unique links
2. People click and register
3. When they deposit and trade, you earn commission

**Earning models:**
- **CPA:** Fixed amount per depositing client ($200-800 typically)
- **Revenue share:** Percentage of spread from ongoing trading

You don't talk to the clients. AvaTrade handles everything—support, account management, compliance. You just drive sign-ups.

**Best for:**
- Content creators
- Website owners
- Digital marketers
- Anyone with online audience but no interest in client management

## The IB (Introducing Broker) Program

IBs have a more hands-on relationship with clients. Think of it as being a local representative for AvaTrade.

**How it works:**
1. You recruit clients directly (often locally)
2. You may provide initial support and education
3. Clients trade, you earn rebates per lot

**Earning model:**
Primarily lot-based rebates. Every time your clients trade, you get a cut of the spread—usually quoted as dollars per lot.

**Example:** $3 per lot on major forex pairs. Your client trades 100 lots/month = $300 to you.

**Best for:**
- Trading educators with active students
- Local brokers in regions where AvaTrade doesn't have direct presence
- Signal providers whose followers actually execute trades
- Anyone willing to provide ongoing client support

## Which Pays More?

Depends entirely on client behavior.

**Affiliate wins if:** Clients deposit once and don't trade much. The CPA covers your cost; revenue share is bonus.

**IB wins if:** Clients are active traders. A client trading 200 lots/month generates far more in lot rebates than a one-time CPA.

High-volume traders make IBs wealthy. Deposit-and-forget clients favor affiliate CPA models.

## Hybrid Approaches

Some partners negotiate hybrid deals:
- CPA for initial acquisition
- Revenue share or lot rebates for ongoing trading

This captures value both on acquisition and retention. Requires negotiation and volume leverage.

## Support Expectations

**Affiliates:** AvaTrade handles all client interactions. You're purely a traffic source.

**IBs:** Clients may contact you first. You're expected to handle basic questions, onboarding help, platform guidance. Escalate complex issues to AvaTrade.

If you don't want client support responsibility, affiliate is cleaner. If you enjoy client relationships (and earn more from them), IB makes sense.

## Regulatory Considerations

IB relationships sometimes have regulatory implications depending on your jurisdiction. In some countries, introducing clients to brokers requires licensing.

Affiliates typically face fewer regulatory hurdles since they're just marketing, not advising or handling funds.

Check local laws before committing to either model. AvaTrade's compliance team can advise on your specific situation.

## Getting Started

**For affiliate:**
Apply through AvaTrade's website → Partners section → Affiliate program

**For IB:**
Apply through AvaTrade's website → Partners section → IB program
Or contact their partnerships team directly for discussion

Both programs have dedicated account managers who explain terms and help optimize your performance.

## Switching Between Programs

Generally possible, but discuss with your account manager. Moving from affiliate to IB (or vice versa) may affect:
- Existing client attribution
- Commission structures
- Contractual terms

Don't switch without understanding the full implications.
