# How To Use AvaTrade Partner Code

Step-by-step instructions for applying partner code **128979** when opening your AvaTrade trading account.

## Before You Start

You'll need:
- Valid email address
- Phone number
- Government-issued ID (for verification)
- Proof of address document

AvaTrade is a regulated broker, so identity verification is mandatory. Have your documents ready to speed up the process.

## Step 1: Go to AvaTrade

Navigate to the AvaTrade website. You can use this link which includes the partner code automatically:

**[AvaTrade Registration (Code 128979)](https://www.avatrade.com/?tag=128979)**

Or go directly to avatrade.com and click "Register" or "Open Account."

## Step 2: Start the Registration Form

Click the registration button. You'll see a form asking for:

- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Country of residence

Fill these in accurately. They need to match your ID documents.

## Step 3: Find the Partner Code Field

Here's where people mess up. The partner code field is NOT obvious. Look for:

- A small text link saying "Have a Partner Code?"
- Or a field labeled "Partner Code" / "Referral Code" / "Promo Code"

It's typically positioned below or near the phone number field. You might need to click to expand it.

## Step 4: Enter 128979

Type the code exactly: **128979**

No spaces. No dashes. Just the six digits.

Double-check before proceeding. Once you submit the form, you can't add the code later.

## Step 5: Complete Registration

Finish the remaining form fields. AvaTrade will ask about:

- Trading experience
- Employment status
- Financial situation

These are regulatory requirements. Answer honestly.

## Step 6: Verify Your Identity

After registration, you'll need to upload:

1. **ID document** - Passport, driver's license, or national ID card
2. **Proof of address** - Utility bill, bank statement, or government letter (dated within 3-6 months)

Upload clear photos or scans. Blurry images get rejected.

Verification usually takes a few hours during business days. Sometimes faster.

## Step 7: Fund Your Account

Once verified, deposit funds. For bonus eligibility:

- **Minimum $1,000** for any bonus
- **Higher deposits** unlock larger bonuses

Payment methods include bank transfer, credit/debit cards, and e-wallets like Skrill and Neteller.

## Step 8: Bonus Activation

Your bonus credit appears automatically after the deposit clears. Check your account balance within 24 hours.

If the bonus doesn't show up, contact AvaTrade support with:
- Your account number
- Screenshot showing you entered the partner code
- Deposit confirmation

## Troubleshooting

**"I forgot to enter the code"**
Unfortunately, codes can't be added retroactively. Contact support, but expect them to say no. You might need to open a new account with a different email.

**"The partner code field isn't showing"**
Some regions don't display the field due to local regulations. Try a different browser or device. If it still doesn't appear, your country might be excluded from the promotion.

**"My bonus didn't arrive"**
Wait 24 hours first. If nothing shows up, check that your deposit met the $1,000 minimum. Contact support if everything looks correct on your end.
