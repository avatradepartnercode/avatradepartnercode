# AvaTrade Spreads and Fees

What does it actually cost to trade at AvaTrade? Here's the breakdown without the marketing fluff.

## How AvaTrade Makes Money

AvaTrade uses a spread-based model. No commissions per trade. The cost is built into the spread—the difference between buy and sell price.

When you see EUR/USD quoted at 1.0850/1.0852, that 2-pip gap is the spread. You pay it on entry. It's the broker's cut.

## Typical Spreads

These numbers fluctuate with market conditions. Tighter during active sessions, wider during low liquidity.

| Instrument | Typical Spread |
|------------|----------------|
| EUR/USD | 0.9 - 1.3 pips |
| GBP/USD | 1.5 - 2.0 pips |
| USD/JPY | 1.1 - 1.5 pips |
| Gold (XAU/USD) | 0.34 - 0.50 |
| S&P 500 | 0.5 - 0.75 points |
| Bitcoin | ~0.5% |

These are retail account spreads. Not the tightest in the industry, not the worst. Middle of the pack for a regulated broker with no commission.

## Comparing to Commission Brokers

Some brokers advertise 0.0 pip spreads but charge $7 per lot commission. Which is better?

**Example trade: 1 lot EUR/USD**

AvaTrade model:
- Spread: 1.0 pip
- Commission: $0
- Total cost: ~$10

Commission broker model:
- Spread: 0.2 pip
- Commission: $7
- Total cost: ~$9

Similar. The "zero spread" broker edges out slightly, but it's close.

For smaller position sizes, spread-only often works out better. Commissions are usually fixed minimums regardless of position size.

## Overnight Financing (Swaps)

Hold a position overnight, you pay or receive swap interest. This reflects the interest rate difference between the two currencies.

Swap rates change daily. Check your platform for current figures.

**Positive swaps** - You receive money (rare on most pairs for retail traders)
**Negative swaps** - You pay money (common)

Long-term position traders care about swaps. Day traders who close before market close don't pay them.

Islamic accounts are swap-free if this is a concern for religious reasons.

## Deposit and Withdrawal Fees

**Deposits:** Free. AvaTrade doesn't charge for incoming funds. Your bank or payment provider might charge on their end.

**Withdrawals:** Free from AvaTrade's side. Again, your receiving bank may have fees.

**Inactivity fee:** After 3 months of no trading, AvaTrade may charge $50/quarter as an inactivity fee. After 12 months inactive, accounts may face additional administration fees.

Solution: Make at least one trade per quarter. Or close your account if you're done.

## Currency Conversion

If your account base currency differs from your deposit currency, conversion happens at market rates plus a small margin.

Example: Account in USD, depositing EUR. You'll get slightly less than the pure market rate.

To avoid this: Open your account in the same currency you'll deposit.

## Hidden Fees?

Nothing truly hidden, but some fees traders miss:

**Guaranteed stop-loss premium** - If you use guaranteed stops, there's a small premium for the guarantee.

**Weekend risk fee** - Holding highly leveraged positions over weekends may incur additional margin requirements or fees during extreme volatility.

**Corporate action fees** - If you hold stock CFDs through dividends or splits, there may be administrative charges.

All documented in the terms. Not hidden, but not loudly advertised either.

## How to Minimize Costs

**Trade during high liquidity hours.** Spreads are tightest during London/New York overlap (roughly 8 AM - 12 PM EST).

**Avoid exotic pairs.** EUR/USD is cheap to trade. USD/TRY is not.

**Close before rollover** if you don't want to pay swaps. Or accept swaps as a cost of swing trading.

**Trade larger positions** if you're active. Spread cost per dollar traded decreases with position size (no commission minimums to worry about).

**Stay active** to avoid inactivity fees. One small trade per quarter keeps your account fee-free.

## Is AvaTrade Expensive?

Compared to ECN brokers with tight spreads and commissions? Slightly.

Compared to retail brokers with no commission? Competitive.

For the average retail trader, AvaTrade's costs are reasonable. You're paying for regulation, stability, and support—not just execution.
