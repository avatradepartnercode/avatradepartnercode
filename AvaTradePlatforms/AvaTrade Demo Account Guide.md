# AvaTrade Demo Account Guide

Demo accounts let you trade with fake money on real market conditions. Here's how to set one up at AvaTrade and use it effectively.

## Getting a Demo Account

Two paths:

**Path 1: Full registration**
Register a live account (enter partner code 128979), and you automatically get demo access too. Same login, toggle between live and demo.

**Path 2: Demo only**
Go to AvaTrade's demo page, enter basic info (name, email, phone), and get instant access. No documents required.

The demo-only path is faster if you just want to test the platform. But you'll need full registration eventually if you decide to trade real money.

## What You Get

- $100,000 in virtual funds (default, can be adjusted)
- Access to all tradeable instruments
- Real-time market prices
- Full platform functionality
- No expiration (as long as you log in periodically)

The demo environment mirrors live trading. Same spreads, same execution, same interface.

## What's Different from Live

**No emotional weight.** Losing $5,000 in demo feels like nothing. Losing $5,000 of real money feels very different. This psychological gap is the main limitation of demo trading.

**Execution might be slightly faster.** Demo servers don't have the same load as live servers. You might notice marginally quicker fills in demo.

**No slippage simulation.** Demo fills at requested price. Live trading during volatility may experience slippage.

**No bonus or real costs.** Demo can't simulate the mental pressure of trading with bonus funds you want to unlock.

## How to Use Demo Productively

Most people waste their demo accounts. They click random buttons, blow up the virtual balance, and learn nothing. Here's a better approach:

**Treat it like real money.** Pretend the virtual balance is your actual savings. Trade the size you'd actually trade. Feel the decisions.

**Test your strategy.** If you have a trading plan, demo is where you prove it works before risking capital.

**Learn the platform.** Demo is perfect for figuring out where buttons are, how orders work, what happens when you modify positions.

**Practice execution.** Get comfortable placing stops, adjusting take profits, closing partial positions. Mechanical skills transfer to live trading.

**Time yourself.** How quickly can you execute a trade from idea to order? Demo lets you build muscle memory.

## Common Demo Mistakes

**Trading too big.** Starting with $100,000 virtual and trading full lots. That's not realistic if you'll deposit $1,000 live.

**Ignoring losses.** "It's just demo" leads to sloppy habits. Those habits carry over to real trading.

**Staying too long.** Demo is training wheels. At some point you need to go live (even with small size) to experience real trading psychology.

**Switching strategies constantly.** Demo is for testing one approach thoroughly, not jumping between systems every day.

## Demo Account Duration

AvaTrade demo accounts don't have a hard expiration date. But if you don't log in for an extended period (typically 30-90 days), the account may be deactivated.

Just log in occasionally to keep it active. Or open a new one—there's no limit.

## Resetting Your Demo

Blew up your virtual balance? You can reset it.

Contact AvaTrade support and request a balance reset. Or open a fresh demo account with a new email.

Some traders intentionally blow up demo accounts to see what maximum drawdown looks like. Valid learning experience.

## Platform Options for Demo

Demo works on:
- MetaTrader 4 (desktop and mobile)
- MetaTrader 5 (desktop and mobile)
- WebTrader (browser)
- AvaTradeGO (mobile app)

Same demo credentials work across all platforms. Test each one to find your preference.

## From Demo to Live

When you're ready to transition:

1. Complete full account verification
2. Fund with your planned trading capital
3. Start with smaller position sizes than demo
4. Accept that live will feel different emotionally

The goal of demo is building skills and confidence. The goal of live is making money while managing risk. Different mindsets.
