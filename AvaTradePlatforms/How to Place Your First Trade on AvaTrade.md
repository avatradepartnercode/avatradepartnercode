# How to Place Your First Trade on AvaTrade

You've registered, deposited, and downloaded a platform. Now what? Here's the step-by-step for executing your first real trade.

## Before You Trade

Make sure you have:
- Verified account
- Funded balance (live) or virtual funds (demo)
- Platform installed (MT4, MT5, or web/mobile app)
- Logged in successfully

If you're nervous about real money, start with demo. Same process, no financial risk.

## Step 1: Choose Your Market

AvaTrade offers 1,250+ instruments. That's overwhelming. Start simple.

**For forex beginners:** EUR/USD. It's the most liquid pair, tightest spreads, most predictable behavior.

**For stock enthusiasts:** Pick a company you know. Apple, Tesla, Amazon. Familiarity helps.

**For commodity interest:** Gold (XAU/USD) is popular. Moves clearly, widely followed.

Don't overthink this. The mechanics are the same regardless of instrument.

## Step 2: Find the Instrument

**On MT4/MT5:**
- Market Watch panel (left side)
- Right-click → Show All (if your instrument isn't visible)
- Double-click the instrument to open order window

**On AvaTradeGO:**
- Search bar at top
- Type instrument name
- Tap to select

**On WebTrader:**
- Instruments list on left
- Click to select

## Step 3: Analyze (Optional)

For your first trade, extensive analysis isn't the point. You're learning execution.

But if you want basic analysis:
- Check the current price
- Look at the daily trend (up, down, sideways)
- Identify nearby support/resistance levels

Don't spend hours on this. You're placing a small trade to learn the process.

## Step 4: Decide Direction

**Buy (Long):** You think price will go up. You profit if price rises.

**Sell (Short):** You think price will go down. You profit if price falls.

Not sure? Pick one. It's your first trade—the learning is more valuable than the outcome.

## Step 5: Set Position Size

This is where new traders make mistakes. They trade too big.

**Conservative starting point:** Risk 1-2% of your account per trade.

If you have $1,000, risk $10-20. For EUR/USD, that means:
- 0.01 lot (micro lot) moves ~$0.10 per pip
- A 100-pip stop loss risks $10

Start with minimum size (0.01 lots). You can always increase later.

## Step 6: Set Stop Loss

A stop loss closes your trade automatically if price goes against you. It limits your loss.

**How to set it:**
- Decide maximum you're willing to lose (e.g., $20)
- Calculate pips: $20 / $0.10 per pip = 200 pips
- Set stop 200 pips from entry

Or simpler: look at the chart, find a logical level where your trade idea is wrong, put stop there.

Always use a stop loss. Non-negotiable.

## Step 7: Set Take Profit (Optional)

Take profit closes your trade automatically when you hit your target. Optional but useful.

If you're targeting 50 pips profit, set TP 50 pips from entry. The platform closes it for you when reached.

You can also close manually later. Your choice.

## Step 8: Execute the Trade

**On MT4/MT5:**
- Fill in volume (lot size)
- Set stop loss price
- Set take profit price (optional)
- Click Buy or Sell

**On AvaTradeGO:**
- Tap Buy or Sell
- Adjust size with slider or input
- Add stop/take profit
- Confirm

**On WebTrader:**
- Similar flow—select instrument, direction, size, stops

Your trade is now live.

## Step 9: Monitor Your Position

Once open, you'll see the trade in your positions panel. It shows:
- Entry price
- Current price
- Profit/loss in real-time
- Stop loss and take profit levels

Don't stare at it constantly. That leads to emotional decisions. Check periodically.

## Step 10: Close the Trade

Three ways to close:

1. **Hit take profit:** Automatic closure at your target
2. **Hit stop loss:** Automatic closure at your limit
3. **Manual close:** Click close/exit on the position

For your first trade, you might want to close manually just to experience the process.

## After Your First Trade

Congratulations. You've executed a trade.

Now reflect:
- What felt confusing?
- What would you do differently?
- Was your position size appropriate?

Record this in a trading journal. The first trade is the start of your learning process, not the end.
