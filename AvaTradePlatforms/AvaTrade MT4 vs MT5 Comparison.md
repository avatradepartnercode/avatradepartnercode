# AvaTrade MT4 vs MT5 Comparison

AvaTrade supports both MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5. Most brokers do. But which should you actually use?

## The Quick Answer

**Use MT4 if:** You trade forex primarily, use existing MT4 expert advisors, or prefer simplicity.

**Use MT5 if:** You want more instruments, better charting, or plan to trade stocks/futures.

Both connect to the same AvaTrade account. You can switch between them.

## History Context

MT4 came out in 2005. It's ancient in software terms, but traders love it. Stable, familiar, massive ecosystem of indicators and EAs.

MT5 launched in 2010 as the successor. More features, better technology. But it never fully replaced MT4 because traders didn't want to migrate.

Now both coexist. Different tools for different needs.

## Key Differences

| Feature | MT4 | MT5 |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Timeframes | 9 | 21 |
| Indicators (built-in) | 30 | 38 |
| Order types | 4 | 6 |
| Pending orders | 4 types | 6 types |
| Economic calendar | No | Yes |
| Depth of market | Basic | Advanced |
| Strategy tester | Single-threaded | Multi-threaded |
| Programming language | MQL4 | MQL5 |

MT5 wins on paper specs. But specs don't tell the whole story.

## Programming Languages

This matters if you use automated strategies.

**MQL4** (MetaTrader 4)
- Simpler syntax
- Huge library of existing EAs and indicators
- Easy to find help online
- Most retail trading tools built for MT4

**MQL5** (MetaTrader 5)
- More powerful language
- Better backtesting capabilities
- Object-oriented programming support
- Smaller ecosystem (but growing)

If you buy or download trading robots, most are MT4-compatible. MT5 selection is smaller.

## Hedging vs. Netting

One thing that confused traders for years: MT5 originally only supported netting mode. If you opened a buy and a sell on the same pair, they'd cancel out.

MT4 supported hedging—keeping both positions open simultaneously.

This has been fixed. MT5 now supports hedging mode too. AvaTrade enables it by default. The distinction doesn't matter much anymore.

## Charting

MT5's charting is noticeably better:
- More timeframes (including 2-hour, 8-hour, etc.)
- More analytical objects
- Better zoom controls
- Cleaner interface

MT4's charting is functional but dated. For serious technical analysis, MT5 has the edge.

## Speed and Stability

MT4 is lightweight. It runs well on old computers and doesn't crash much. Two decades of bug fixes make it reliable.

MT5 is heavier but handles complex operations better. The multi-threaded strategy tester runs backtests much faster than MT4's single-threaded version.

For day-to-day trading, both perform fine. For heavy backtesting, MT5 saves significant time.

## What Most People Use

At AvaTrade specifically? Most clients still use MT4.

It's not because MT4 is better. It's because:
- Traders already know it
- Their indicators/EAs work on it
- There's no compelling reason to switch

Newer traders increasingly start with MT5. They don't have MT4 habits to break.

## Mobile Apps

Both platforms have mobile apps (iOS and Android). The MT5 mobile app is slightly more polished—newer interface, more indicators. MT4 mobile works fine but looks dated.

If you trade mainly from your phone, MT5 mobile is the better experience.

## AvaTrade's Other Options

You don't have to use MetaTrader at all. AvaTrade also offers:

**WebTrader** - Browser-based platform, no download needed
**AvaTradeGO** - AvaTrade's proprietary mobile app
**AvaOptions** - For options trading specifically

Some traders use MetaTrader for analysis and AvaTrade's platforms for execution. You can mix and match.

## My Take

For most AvaTrade users:

**MT4** if you already use it or have existing tools built for it.

**MT5** if you're starting fresh and want the best feature set.

Neither choice is wrong. They both connect to the same account, execute the same instruments, at the same prices. It's just interface preference.
