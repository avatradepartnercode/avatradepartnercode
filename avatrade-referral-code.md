# AvaTrade Referral Code

**Referral Code: 128979**

AvaTrade's referral program lets existing partners share codes with new traders. When you register using referral code **128979**, you gain access to the broker's deposit bonus structure.

## Referral vs. Partner vs. Bonus Code

People search for different terms, but they all mean the same thing at AvaTrade:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Referral code | Code shared by existing partner |
| Partner code | Same as referral code |
| Bonus code | Same as partner/referral code |
| Promo code | Same as above |

The registration form might use any of these labels depending on your region. They all connect to the same promotional system. **128979** works regardless of what the field is called.

## What the Referral Code Unlocks

Using a referral code qualifies your account for tiered welcome bonuses:

| Deposit | Bonus |
|---------|-------|
| $1,000+ | $200 |
| $2,000+ | $400 |
| $5,000+ | $1,000 |
| $10,000+ | $2,500 |
| $25,000+ | $5,000 |
| $100,000+ | Up to $14,000 |

No referral code = no bonus eligibility. The system requires a valid code to activate promotional offers.

## Applying the Referral Code

During AvaTrade registration:

1. Fill in personal details (name, email, phone)
2. Find the referral/partner code field
3. Type **128979**
4. Complete registration and verification
5. Deposit $1,000 or more

Bonus credit appears in your account after your deposit processes. Typically takes less than 24 hours.

## Why Referral Codes Exist

AvaTrade, like most brokers, runs an affiliate program. Partners promote the broker and earn commission when referred traders sign up and deposit. The referral code tracks which partner sent you.

From your perspective, this costs you nothing. You get the same trading conditions as any other client, plus bonus eligibility. The broker pays the partner from their marketing budget.

## Things to Consider

**Timing matters.** The referral code must be entered during initial registration. After your account exists, you can't add it.

**Geography matters.** Bonus structures vary by country. Some regions (especially EU) have limited or no bonus availability due to regulations.

**Volume matters.** Bonus funds aren't free cash. Trading requirements apply before withdrawal. Read the terms.
