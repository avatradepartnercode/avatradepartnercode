# AvaTrade Bonus Terms Explained

Nobody reads terms and conditions. But with trading bonuses, you probably should. Here's what you're actually agreeing to.

## The Basics

When you accept an AvaTrade bonus, you're entering a promotional agreement. The bonus isn't a gift—it's an incentive with strings attached.

Key points:
- Bonus credit isn't cash
- Withdrawal conditions apply
- The offer can be modified or cancelled
- Abuse gets your account flagged

## Eligibility

Not everyone qualifies for bonuses. Standard requirements:

**New accounts only.** Existing clients can't claim welcome bonuses. One bonus per person, per household, per IP address.

**Minimum deposit.** The bonus structure starts at $1,000. Smaller deposits don't trigger any bonus, even with a valid partner code.

**Verification required.** Your account must be fully verified before bonus credit applies. Upload your documents promptly.

**Geographic restrictions.** EU residents face limitations due to ESMA regulations. Some countries are excluded entirely.

## The Volume Requirement

This is where people get tripped up.

AvaTrade requires you to trade a certain volume before bonus funds become withdrawable. The calculation:

**Bonus Amount × Multiplier = Required Volume (in USD notional)**

The multiplier varies by promotion but typically ranges from 10,000 to 25,000 per dollar of bonus. A $200 bonus with a 10,000x multiplier means you need to trade $2,000,000 in notional volume.

That sounds huge, but a single standard lot of EUR/USD is about $100,000 notional. Twenty lots gets you there.

## Time Limits

Bonuses don't last forever.

**Claiming period.** You typically have 30 days from account opening to make your qualifying deposit and claim the bonus.

**Completion period.** Most promotions give you 6-12 months to meet the trading volume requirement. After that, unreleased bonus funds expire.

Check your specific offer for exact dates.

## Withdrawal Impact

Withdrawing funds before completing requirements affects your bonus. The typical structure:

- Withdraw any amount = forfeit entire bonus
- Withdraw after partial completion = forfeit remaining bonus
- Internal transfers may or may not count as withdrawals

Some promotions are more flexible. Others are strict. Read yours.

## Prohibited Activities

AvaTrade monitors for bonus abuse. Things that get you in trouble:

**Hedging across accounts.** Opening opposite positions in multiple accounts to lock in the bonus without risk.

**Arbitrage schemes.** Exploiting price differences or latency for risk-free profit.

**Multiple accounts.** Opening several accounts to claim multiple bonuses.

**Collusion.** Working with other traders to manipulate the system.

Violations result in bonus cancellation, profit reversal, and potential account closure.

## Can Terms Change?

Yes. AvaTrade reserves the right to modify or cancel promotions. If they change the terms after you've started:

- Existing progress usually carries over
- New requirements apply going forward
- In rare cases, promotions end early

They'll notify you of material changes, but you should still check periodically.

## The Fine Print Summary

Bonuses are marketing tools. They're designed to get you trading and keep you trading. The terms ensure you can't just grab the money and run.

For active traders, the terms are reasonable. You'd hit the requirements naturally.

For everyone else, decide if the bonus actually benefits your trading style before accepting it.
