# AvaTrade Deposit Bonus Tiers

AvaTrade's bonus system is tiered. More money in, more bonus out. Here's the breakdown.

## The Tier Structure

| Tier | Deposit Range | Bonus | Effective Rate |
|------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | $1,000 - $1,999 | $200 | 10-20% |
| 2 | $2,000 - $4,999 | $400 | 8-20% |
| 3 | $5,000 - $9,999 | $1,000 | 10-20% |
| 4 | $10,000 - $24,999 | $2,500 | 10-25% |
| 5 | $25,000 - $49,999 | $5,000 | 10-20% |
| 6 | $100,000+ | Up to $14,000 | Up to 14% |

Notice the effective rate isn't consistent. Depositing exactly $1,000 gets you 20%. Depositing $1,999 gets you about 10%. Same $200 bonus either way.

## Sweet Spots

If you're optimizing:

**$1,000 exactly** - 20% bonus. Best percentage at the entry level.

**$5,000 exactly** - 20% bonus. Jumps from $400 to $1,000, so the threshold matters.

**$10,000 exactly** - 25% bonus. Another big jump point.

**$25,000 exactly** - 20% bonus. Gets you to the $5,000 tier.

The worst spots are just under each threshold. $4,999 gets you $400. $5,000 gets you $1,000. That extra dollar is worth $600 in bonus.

## Below $1,000

Nothing. Zero bonus.

You can open an AvaTrade account with as little as $100, but the bonus structure doesn't kick in below $1,000. The partner code won't help you if you're depositing $500.

## Above $100,000

The top tier says "up to $14,000" because it's not a fixed amount. Contact AvaTrade directly for exact figures on large deposits. They may negotiate.

High-net-worth clients often get custom terms that aren't published publicly.

## Multiple Deposits

The welcome bonus applies to your first deposit only. You can't deposit $1,000 five times and get five bonuses.

However, AvaTrade occasionally runs reload promotions for existing clients. These are separate from the welcome bonus and have their own terms.

## Choosing Your Tier

Think about it this way:

**Don't stretch uncomfortably.** If $1,000 is your comfortable trading capital, don't push to $2,000 just for an extra $200 bonus. The bonus isn't worth overextending yourself.

**Do hit thresholds if close.** If you were planning to deposit $4,800, bump it to $5,000. That $200 difference gets you $600 more in bonus.

**Consider the volume requirement.** Higher bonuses mean higher volume requirements. A $5,000 bonus might require 50+ lots to unlock. Make sure that's realistic for your trading style.

## Bonus vs. Capital Efficiency

A philosophical point:

More capital generally means more flexibility in trading. But bonus capital isn't the same as deposited capital. You can't withdraw it freely.

A $10,000 deposit with $2,500 bonus gives you $12,500 in trading power. But if you need to withdraw $5,000 for an emergency, you lose the bonus.

Your deposited funds remain liquid. Bonus funds don't.

Factor that into your decision. Sometimes a smaller deposit with a smaller bonus is more practical than maximizing the bonus percentage.
