# AvaTrade Welcome Bonus Guide

First-time depositors at AvaTrade can claim bonus credit ranging from $200 to $14,000. Here's everything you need to know before signing up.

## How the Welcome Bonus Works

AvaTrade's welcome bonus is a deposit-based promotion. You fund your account, they add bonus credit on top. The amount scales with your deposit:

| Deposit | Bonus |
|---------|-------|
| $1,000 - $1,999 | $200 |
| $2,000 - $4,999 | $400 |
| $5,000 - $9,999 | $1,000 |
| $10,000 - $24,999 | $2,500 |
| $25,000 - $49,999 | $5,000 |
| $100,000+ | Up to $14,000 |

The percentage isn't linear. Larger deposits get proportionally better bonuses. At the $1,000 level you're getting 20%. At $100,000 you could be getting 14%.

## Getting the Bonus

Three requirements:

1. **Use a partner code during registration.** Enter **128979** in the partner code field. Without it, you won't be eligible for the welcome bonus.

2. **Complete account verification.** Upload your ID and proof of address. AvaTrade won't credit bonuses to unverified accounts.

3. **Deposit the minimum.** $1,000 or more. Anything less and you get nothing, even with the code.

The bonus usually appears within 24 hours of your deposit clearing.

## What the Bonus Actually Is

This trips people up. The bonus isn't cash you can withdraw. It's trading credit.

Think of it as extra margin. A $1,200 deposit with a $200 bonus gives you $1,400 in trading power. You can open larger positions than your cash alone would allow.

Profits from those positions are yours. The bonus credit itself requires meeting trading volume conditions before it converts to withdrawable funds.

## Who Should Care About This

**Active traders.** If you trade regularly, you'll hit the volume requirements naturally. The bonus is essentially free capital.

**Larger depositors.** The percentage improves at higher tiers. Someone depositing $25,000 gets a $5,000 bonus (20%). That's meaningful capital.

**People who'd open an account anyway.** If you've already decided to trade with AvaTrade, the bonus is just upside. You lose nothing by using the partner code.

## Who Shouldn't Obsess Over This

**Small depositors.** If you're starting with $500, you don't qualify. Don't stretch to $1,000 just for a $200 bonus if that's not comfortable.

**Infrequent traders.** If you make three trades per year, you'll never hit the volume requirement. The bonus will just sit there.

**EU residents.** ESMA regulations limit bonus offers for retail clients in Europe. You might not be eligible at all.

## The Catch

There's always a catch. Here it is:

You must trade a certain volume before the bonus becomes withdrawable. The exact requirement varies, but expect something like 10,000-25,000 USD notional per dollar of bonus.

For a $200 bonus with a 10,000x requirement, that's $2,000,000 in trading volume. Sounds scary, but 20 standard lots of EUR/USD covers it.

If you withdraw before completing the requirement, you forfeit the bonus.

## Comparing to Other Brokers

AvaTrade's bonus structure is middle-of-the-pack for percentage, but high for maximum amount. The $14,000 ceiling on large deposits beats most competitors.

XM offers a $30 no-deposit bonus, which AvaTrade doesn't have. But AvaTrade's deposit match goes higher at the top end.

Different structures suit different traders. There's no universal "best."
