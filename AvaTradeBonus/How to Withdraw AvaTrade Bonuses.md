# How to Withdraw AvaTrade Bonuses

You got the bonus. Now what? Here's how the withdrawal process actually works.

## The Short Answer

You can't withdraw bonus credit directly. That's not how it works at AvaTrade or any other broker offering deposit bonuses.

The bonus is trading credit. You use it to open larger positions. Profits you make from trading can be withdrawn, but the bonus itself stays in your account until you meet certain conditions.

## Trading Volume Requirements

AvaTrade requires you to trade a certain volume before bonus funds convert to withdrawable cash. The exact requirement depends on:

- Your deposit amount
- The bonus tier you received
- Current promotional terms

Typically, you need to trade a multiple of your bonus in lot volume. For example, a $200 bonus might require 20-40 lots of trading before it unlocks.

Check your account dashboard or contact support for your specific requirement. It varies.

## What Happens If You Withdraw Early

If you request a withdrawal before meeting the volume requirement, one of two things happens:

1. **Partial withdrawal**: You withdraw your deposited funds, but the bonus (and any profits attributed to it) gets forfeited.

2. **Proportional reduction**: Some bonus structures reduce your bonus proportionally when you withdraw part of your deposit.

Read the terms carefully. Withdrawing $500 of a $1,000 deposit might cancel your entire bonus, not just half of it.

## The Withdrawal Process Itself

Once you've met the requirements:

1. Log into your AvaTrade account
2. Go to the withdrawal section
3. Select your payment method
4. Enter the amount
5. Submit the request

Processing times depend on the method:
- E-wallets: Usually same day
- Credit/debit cards: 1-3 business days
- Bank transfers: 3-7 business days

AvaTrade doesn't charge withdrawal fees, but your bank or payment provider might.

## Tips for Getting There Faster

**Trade what you'd trade anyway.** Don't force trades just to hit the volume requirement. Bad trades cost more than the bonus is worth.

**Use appropriate position sizes.** Trading larger positions accumulates volume faster, but also increases risk. Don't blow your account chasing a $200 bonus.

**Track your progress.** AvaTrade's dashboard shows how close you are to the requirement. Check it regularly.

**Ask support.** If you're confused about where you stand, open a chat. They can tell you exactly how much volume remains.

## Is It Worth It?

Depends on your trading style.

If you're an active trader who'd hit the volume requirements naturally, the bonus is free money. You were going to trade anyway.

If you're a casual trader who makes a few trades per month, the bonus might take a year to unlock. At that point, is it really benefiting you?

Do the math for your situation before obsessing over bonus withdrawal.
