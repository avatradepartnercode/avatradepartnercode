# AvaTrade Verification Process

Every regulated broker requires identity verification. Here's how AvaTrade's process works and how to get through it quickly.

## Why Verification Exists

It's called KYC—Know Your Customer. Financial regulations require brokers to verify who their clients are. This prevents:
- Money laundering
- Terrorist financing
- Identity fraud
- Underage trading

AvaTrade holds licenses from FCA, ASIC, CySEC, and other regulators. They all mandate KYC procedures.

You can't avoid it. But you can make it painless.

## What You Need

**Proof of Identity (one of these):**
- Passport (most universally accepted)
- National ID card (both sides)
- Driver's license (both sides)

The document must be:
- Currently valid (not expired)
- Clearly legible
- Showing your full legal name
- Showing your date of birth

**Proof of Address (one of these):**
- Utility bill (gas, electric, water)
- Bank statement
- Government-issued letter
- Tax statement

The document must be:
- Dated within the last 3-6 months
- Showing your full name
- Showing your current residential address
- Matching the address you registered with

## How to Submit

During or after registration, you'll reach the verification section. You can:

**Upload directly:** Use the web interface to upload photos or scans. This is fastest.

**Email:** Send documents to the verification team if upload fails.

**App:** AvaTradeGO lets you take photos with your phone and submit directly.

## Getting Good Images

Most rejections happen because images are unreadable. Avoid common mistakes:

**Do:**
- Use good lighting
- Hold camera parallel to document (no angles)
- Include all four corners
- Make sure text is sharp and readable
- Use high resolution settings

**Don't:**
- Take photos in dim lighting
- Crop any edges off
- Use flash that creates glare
- Screenshot your online bank statement
- Submit blurry photos

Phone cameras work fine if you're careful. Scanners produce better results if you have access.

## Processing Time

AvaTrade reviews documents manually. Expect:
- Business hours (Mon-Fri): 2-6 hours typically
- Submitted overnight: Next business day
- Weekend submissions: Monday processing

If your documents are clean and clear, approval is straightforward. Complex cases or unclear images take longer.

## Common Rejection Reasons

**"Document expired"** — Your ID is out of date. You need a valid document.

**"Document illegible"** — Image quality too low. Retake with better lighting.

**"Address mismatch"** — The address on your document doesn't match registration. Either re-register with correct address or submit a different document.

**"Name mismatch"** — Your registered name doesn't match your ID exactly. Contact support to correct your registration.

**"Document type not accepted"** — They need a specific type you didn't provide. Check what's actually required.

## Partial Verification

Some brokers allow trading with partial verification. AvaTrade generally requires full verification before:
- Depositing funds
- Receiving bonus credit
- Trading live markets

Demo accounts don't require verification.

## Resubmitting

If rejected, you'll get an email explaining why. Address the issue and resubmit.

Don't just send the same image again. They rejected it for a reason. Fix that reason first.

If you're stuck:
- Try a different document type
- Use a scanner instead of phone
- Contact support for specific guidance

## Privacy Concerns

Your documents are encrypted and stored securely. AvaTrade is legally required to:
- Protect your personal data
- Not share it unnecessarily
- Delete it when no longer required (varies by jurisdiction)

Regulated brokers take data protection seriously. Violations mean massive fines and license revocation.

## After Approval

Once verified, you can:
- Deposit funds
- Receive your bonus (if you used partner code 128979)
- Start live trading
- Access all account features

Verification is a one-time process unless you change addresses or your documents expire.
