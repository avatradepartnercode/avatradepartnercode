# How to Register on AvaTrade Step by Step

The registration process takes about 10 minutes if you have your documents ready. Here's exactly what happens.

## Before You Start

Grab these:
- Government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID)
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, or government letter dated within 3-6 months)
- Your phone for verification codes

You'll also need to decide on a deposit amount if you want the welcome bonus. Minimum is $1,000 for any bonus credit.

## Step 1: Go to AvaTrade

Head to the AvaTrade website. You can use this link which includes the partner code:

**[AvaTrade Registration](https://www.avatrade.com/?tag=128979)**

Or go directly and enter the code manually later.

Click "Register" or "Open Account" to start.

## Step 2: Basic Information

First screen asks for:
- **Full name** (must match your ID exactly)
- **Email address** (use one you check regularly)
- **Phone number** (include country code)
- **Country of residence**

Double-check spelling. Mismatches between your registration and ID documents cause verification delays.

## Step 3: Partner Code

Look for the field that says "Have a Partner Code?" or similar. It's usually below or near the phone number field.

Enter: **128979**

This is important. Skip this step and you won't qualify for the deposit bonus. The code can't be added after registration.

## Step 4: Personal Details

Next screens ask about:
- **Date of birth**
- **Address** (must match your proof of address document)
- **Tax identification number** (some regions require this)

Regulatory stuff. Brokers are required to collect this information.

## Step 5: Financial Questions

AvaTrade will ask about:
- **Employment status**
- **Annual income range**
- **Net worth range**
- **Source of funds**
- **Trading experience**

These questions are for regulatory compliance and risk assessment. Answer honestly. They're not trying to reject you—they need this for their records.

Some answers may affect your available leverage or account features, depending on your jurisdiction.

## Step 6: Account Password

Create a password for your trading account. Standard advice applies:
- At least 8 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- Don't reuse passwords from other sites

You'll use this to log into the trading platform and web portal.

## Step 7: Email Verification

AvaTrade sends a confirmation email. Click the link to verify your address.

Check spam if you don't see it within a few minutes. The email comes from an @avatrade.com address.

## Step 8: Document Upload

Now for identity verification. You'll need to upload:

**Proof of Identity**
- Clear photo of your passport, driver's license, or national ID
- Both sides if applicable
- All four corners visible
- No glare or blur

**Proof of Address**
- Utility bill, bank statement, or government letter
- Must show your name and address
- Dated within the last 3-6 months
- Full document visible

Upload tips:
- Photos work fine, scans work better
- PDF format if scanning
- Make sure text is readable
- Avoid screenshots of statements—use actual documents

## Step 9: Wait for Verification

AvaTrade reviews your documents manually. Typical timeframes:
- During business hours: 2-4 hours
- Overnight/weekend: Next business day

If something's wrong, they'll email you explaining the issue. Common problems:
- Blurry images
- Expired documents
- Address mismatch
- Missing pages

## Step 10: Fund Your Account

Once verified, you can deposit. Options include:
- Bank transfer
- Credit/debit card
- Skrill, Neteller, and other e-wallets
- Local payment methods depending on your country

For the welcome bonus, deposit at least $1,000.

Processing times:
- Cards: Instant or same day
- E-wallets: Instant
- Bank transfer: 1-5 business days

## Step 11: Start Trading

After your deposit clears:
- Download MT4, MT5, or use the web platform
- Your bonus credit (if applicable) appears within 24 hours
- You're ready to trade
