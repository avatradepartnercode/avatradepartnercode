# AvaTrade Account Types Compared

AvaTrade keeps it simple. You're mostly choosing between retail and professional status, not a maze of account tiers.

## The Main Account Types

**Retail Account**
The standard option for individual traders. You get:
- Access to all platforms (MT4, MT5, WebTrader, AvaTradeGO)
- Full instrument range
- Leverage capped by regulation (varies by region)
- Negative balance protection
- Welcome bonus eligibility (with partner code)

Most people end up here. It's the default.

**Professional Account**
For experienced traders who qualify. Requirements typically include:
- Significant trading history (10+ substantial trades per quarter)
- Large portfolio ($500,000+ in financial instruments)
- Professional financial sector experience

Professional accounts get higher leverage but lose some retail protections like negative balance protection.

**Islamic Account**
Swap-free accounts for traders who observe Islamic finance principles. No overnight interest charges. Same trading conditions otherwise.

## What About All Those Account Names?

If you've seen references to "Silver," "Gold," "Platinum" accounts—those aren't separate account types. They're loyalty tiers that unlock based on your deposit size and trading activity.

Higher tiers get perks like:
- Dedicated account manager
- Better customer support priority
- Access to premium research
- Exclusive promotions

But your actual trading account is still a retail, professional, or Islamic account underneath.

## Spread Accounts vs. Commission Accounts

AvaTrade primarily uses a spread-based model. You don't pay commissions per trade; instead, the cost is built into the spread.

This differs from brokers that charge tight spreads plus a commission per lot. Neither model is inherently better—total cost depends on the specific numbers.

AvaTrade's spread-only approach simplifies cost calculation. You see the spread, you know the cost. No mental math required.

## Choosing the Right Type

**Go retail if:**
- You're an individual trader
- You want bonus eligibility
- You prefer regulatory protections
- You don't meet professional requirements

**Consider professional if:**
- You qualify (check the requirements)
- You want higher leverage
- You understand the reduced protections
- You trade frequently at large sizes

**Request Islamic if:**
- Your faith requires swap-free trading
- You hold positions overnight regularly
- Standard accounts create religious compliance issues

## Account Opening Is the Same

Regardless of which type you want, the registration process is identical:

1. Complete registration
2. Enter partner code **128979**
3. Verify identity
4. Fund your account

After opening, you can:
- Apply for professional status upgrade
- Request Islamic account conversion
- Maintain retail status (no action needed)

You're not locked in. Account type can change after opening.

## Demo Accounts

Every live account comes with demo access. Same platforms, real market data, virtual funds.

Use demo to:
- Learn the interface
- Test strategies
- Practice execution
- Try different instruments

No risk, no cost. There's no reason not to use it before going live.

## Regional Differences

Account features vary by jurisdiction. EU traders have different leverage limits than Australian traders. Japanese regulations differ from South African ones.

AvaTrade operates under multiple licenses:
- FCA (UK)
- ASIC (Australia)
- CySEC (Cyprus)
- FSA (Japan)
- FSCA (South Africa)
- And others

Your country determines which entity you trade with and which rules apply. The account structure remains similar, but specific limits change.
